## Summary
- Cool, we've used strings to make a program that made a welcome message. Now let's use some numerical types.

#### Create program that calculates the year of birth.

* Tasks
* define the variables age and name
* make a calculation for the year in which the person was born
* print out "OMG <person>, you are <age> years old so you were born in <year>" with the correct values
#### Second Part
* prompt the user for input and re-assign the variable age and name
* figure out a way to account for if the persons birthday has already happened this year or not
#### Extra
* go look into the library time
* print out the amount of hour this person has lived
#### Acceptance Criteria
* program defines the variable age and name
* program prints the string "OMG <person>, you are <age> years old so you were born in <year>"
